ðŸ“±ðŸ““ Cross-platform app for iOS and Android for organizing information about friends!

### Problem:
There are a lot of people around us who have a huge number of skills that could be useful in a project or in life. But it's too difficult to remember all the details! :sob:

### Solution:
So I decided to write an app for people who feel the power of connections! :star:

The app will help you quickly save information about a new friend. And then use the internal search engine to quickly find a person by their skill or name.
