# TriTri

ðŸ“±ðŸ““ Cross-platform app for iOS and Android for organizing information about friends!

### Problem:
There are a lot of people around us who have a huge number of skills that could be useful in a project or in life. But it's too difficult to remember all the details! :sob:

### Solution:
So I decided to write an app for people who feel the power of connections! :star:

The app will help you quickly save information about a new friend. And then use the internal search engine to quickly find a person by their skill or name.

### App features:
* Added cards are displayed on the main screen:
<div>

  <img width="20">
  <img src="https://github.com/zkerriga/tritri/blob/main/screenshots/card-create.png" width="200">
  <img width="20">
  <img src="https://github.com/zkerriga/tritri/blob/main/screenshots/home.png" width="200">
</div>
<br>

* You can open a menu that displays some statistics:

  <img width="20">
  <img src="https://github.com/zkerriga/tritri/blob/main/screenshots/menu2.png" width="200">
</div>
<br>

* There is a convenient search in all fields of the map, any card can be opened:

  <img width="20">

  <img width="20">
  <img src="https://github.com/zkerriga/tritri/blob/main/screenshots/search3.png" width="200">

</div>
<br>

* Syncing is not available yet, but you can copy the database manually (the app requires permission to create the database):
<div>

  <img width="20">
  <img src="https://github.com/zkerriga/tritri/blob/main/screenshots/database.png" width="200">
  <img width="20">

</div>
<br>

### Development:
The app is written using the [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/) in Google's [Dart](https://dart.dev/) language.
To start a project, you need to:
1. Install the IDE
2. Follow [these instructions](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) to install Flutter SDK
3. Download the project: `git clone https://github.com/zkerriga/tritri`
4. Run the project as a Flutter project
5. Connect a mobile device or set up an emulator

### Plans:
- [x] Create the ability to save the database
- [ ] Develop the ability to sync with the cloud
- [ ] Add card editing
- [ ] Create an option to block the app
- [ ] Define pages for blocks in the menu
- [ ] Make entering information fast with smart field navigation
- [ ] Create an achievement system

### Team:
So far, I work alone, but I will be happy to cooperate! :wink:
